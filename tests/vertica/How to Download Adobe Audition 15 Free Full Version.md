One option is to use the official Adobe website and sign up for a 7-day free trial of Audition. This will let you access the latest version of the software, which has more features and improvements than the older 1.5 version. To do this, you need to click the Start Free Trial button on the [Audition page](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition/free-trial-download.html), sign in or create an Adobe ID, and download the installer. After the trial ends, you can either cancel or continue with a paid subscription[^2^].
 
Another option is to use a third-party website that offers Adobe Audition 1.5 free download links. However, this is not recommended as it may be illegal, unsafe, or outdated. Some of these websites may contain viruses, malware, or spyware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. Some of them may also provide fake or corrupted files that won't work properly or at all. Therefore, you should be very careful and cautious when using these websites and always scan the files before opening them.
 
One example of such a website is [Get Into PC](https://getintopc.com/softwares/audio-processing/adobe-audition-1-5-free-download/), which claims to offer Adobe Audition 1.5 free download with an offline installer and standalone setup[^1^]. Another example is [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/AdobeAudition1.5_201408), which claims to have Adobe Audition 1.5 files available for download[^3^]. However, these websites are not affiliated with Adobe and may not have the authorization or permission to distribute their software. Therefore, you should use them at your own risk and discretion.
 
In conclusion, if you want to download Adobe Audition 1.5 free full version, you can either try the official Adobe website for a 7-day free trial of the latest version or use a third-party website that offers older versions for free download. However, you should be aware of the potential risks and drawbacks of using unofficial sources and always protect your computer and data from possible threats.
