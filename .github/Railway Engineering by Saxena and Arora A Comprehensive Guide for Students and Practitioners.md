# Railway Engineering by Saxena and Arora: A Comprehensive Guide for Students and Practitioners
 
Railway engineering is a branch of civil engineering that deals with the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of railways. Railway engineers have to consider various aspects such as track structure, signalling, rolling stock, bridges, tunnels, stations, and safety. Railway engineering is a challenging and rewarding field that requires a sound knowledge of engineering principles, mathematics, physics, and management.

One of the most popular and widely used books on railway engineering is *Railway Engineering* by S.C. Saxena and S.P. Arora. This book covers all the topics related to railway engineering in a systematic and comprehensive manner. The book is divided into four parts: Part I deals with introduction to railway engineering, rail gauges, surveys and alignment of railway lines; Part II covers track structure, rails, sleepers, ballast, track fittings and fastenings, track stresses and geometrics; Part III discusses signalling and interlocking, level crossings, train control systems, railway accidents and safety; Part IV focuses on rolling stock, locomotives, coaches and wagons, train resistance and tractive effort, scheduling and management of railway operations.
 
The book is written in a simple and lucid language with numerous examples, diagrams, tables, and charts. The book also contains objective type questions, review questions, and numerical problems at the end of each chapter. The book is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate students of civil engineering as well as practicing railway engineers.
 
*Railway Engineering* by S.C. Saxena and S.P. Arora is available in PDF format for free download from various online sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. However, it is recommended to buy the original book from a reputed publisher or online store to support the authors and get the latest edition.
  
Railway engineering is not only a theoretical subject but also a practical one that involves various types of projects. Railway projects can range from small-scale track maintenance and renewal to large-scale network expansion and modernization. Railway projects can also involve different modes of transport such as metro, light rail, tram, commuter rail, high-speed rail, and freight rail.
 
Some of the examples of railway engineering projects around the world are:
 
- The Crossrail project in London, UK, which is a 118 km new railway line that will connect east and west London with 42 km of tunnels and 10 new stations[^2^]. The project is expected to be completed by 2022 and will increase the rail capacity of London by 10%.
- The Riyadh Metro project in Saudi Arabia, which is a 176 km metro network with six lines and 85 stations that will serve the capital city of Riyadh[^3^]. The project is expected to be completed by 2021 and will reduce traffic congestion and pollution in the city.
- The California High-Speed Rail project in the USA, which is a 1,300 km high-speed rail system that will connect major cities in California such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego. The project is expected to be completed by 2033 and will reduce travel time and greenhouse gas emissions.

Railway engineering projects require a multidisciplinary approach that involves various stakeholders such as governments, railway authorities, contractors, consultants, suppliers, operators, and users. Railway engineering projects also face various challenges such as technical complexity, environmental impact, social acceptance, cost control, safety management, and regulatory compliance. Railway engineering projects need to adopt innovative solutions and best practices to overcome these challenges and deliver successful outcomes.
